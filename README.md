WeatherApp
==========
This is the 'Accessible Weather' android application

Note that this application was developed using the Android Studio, not the Eclipse with ADT plugin development environment.
The structure of this project may therefore appear different from the structure of an android application developed in eclipse.

The .apk file is located in the \AccessibleWeather\app\ folder.

The application is no longer live unfortunately. When it does go live, it can be found at:
